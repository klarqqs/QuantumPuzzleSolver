## QuantumPuzzle Solver
Learn quantum computing through addictive play. Grover's algorithm becomes a glowing grid puzzle—intuition first, formulas later.

### Why Play?
- Superposition: All cells glow equally.
- Oracle: Secretly marks your target.
- Amplification: Winner pulses brighter—click it to win!
- Progressive tiers + noisy/real sims teach real quantum limits.

### New in v0.2 (Planned)
- Bloch sphere visualizer
- Daily challenges
- Noisy/decoherence mode
- Accessibility: color-blind modes, voice narration

### Tech
- Godot 4.3+ (cross-platform: web, mobile, desktop)
- Pure GDScript sim (fast) + optional Qiskit bridge (accurate)
- MIT license — fork for schools!

Roadmap: MVP in 2 weeks → full release in 8.
